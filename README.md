# textanalysis
Analyzing news articles using Python

Aim of the Project: 
- To better understand the underlying trends in the national/international political scene by applying text analysis methods to collections of articles. 

Stage/Methodology: 
- Right now, only contributor is me. 
- I have started by scraping around 800 articles that are about Turkey (the country) from the Reuters news archives. The dates of the articles are between 12/21/2015-11/27/2016. 
- Two main methods come into mind: one is to apply different clustering algorithms to see how many articles are written about which topic during the given timeframe, and the other is to see how counts of various important words have changed over time.
- Done with the data cleaning part, need to create vectors for each document so that I can apply k-means clustering.

Future Direction:
- Code is hacky at the moment. Make improvements over time. Need to better understand data structures and how to make algorithms more efficient. 
- Improve the accuracy and the speed of the analysis, and apply it to various types of articles over time.
- Be able to understand how different clusters of these articles change over time (basically unsupervised learning with the time dimension added to it).
- Become proficient in choosing the right algorithm depending on the dataset at hand. 
- Standardize an approach so that people can learn from this and apply it to collections of texts that fall into their areas of interest.
