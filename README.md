# textanalysis
Analyzing news articles using Python

Aim of the Project: 
- To better understand the underlying trends in the national/international political scene by applying text analysis methods to collections of articles. 

Notes: 
- Scrape method can be found in "only_summaries" files
- For K_means:
    - Only_summaries means that I have used the summaries of articles for the analysis
    - Articles means that I have used whole articles for the analysis.
